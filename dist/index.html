      <h1>SD-HQ Rules of Engagement</h1>
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <p>
        Attributes represent the abilities of each employee. Each attribute is on a scale from the left side sub-attribute to the right side sub-attribute. Employees who are skilled in a left side attribute succeed a roll if the die rolls a number above their attribute number and those with a right side attribute succeed if the roll is below their attriibute number.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example</em>: An employee with an attribute rank of 3 in Charm would be an Introvert and would succeed if they rolled a 3 or above on the die and fail if they rolled a 2 or below. An employee with a 7 in Charm would be an Extrovert and would succeed with a roll of 7 or below and fail with a roll of 8 or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each employee has <em>12 attribute points</em> to distribute among their attributes. Each attribute must be given at least 1 point. Points are assigned starting in the 5 or 6 position depending on whether a left side or right side attribute is selected. Once a point is selected on the left side, points cannot be added to the right side and vice versa. Points cannot be placed in the 1 or 10 position.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example</em>: An employee who put 3 points into Feather Weight would put their first point in position 5, the next in position 4, and the last in position 3. Their Athletics rank would therefore be 3.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Charm</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Introvert</em>: The ability to blend in, deceive, and hide.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h3>Athletics</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Feather Weight</em>: The ability to swiftly and dexterously perform a physical action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Heavy Weight</em>: The ability to use sheer strength and bulk to perform an action.
      </p>

      <h3>Tough</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Defense</em>: The ability to block, divert, or protect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Offense</em>: The ability to attack, intimidate, or overwhelm.
      </p>

      <h3>Sharp</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      
      <h2>Luck</h2>
      <p>
        When an employee's roll is the same as their attribute rank, they are granted a Luck point. Luck points may be used immediately or stored and used later. The employee can have a maximum of 5 Luck points stored at a time. Luck points can be used to give the employee an advantage such as adding or subtracting 1 from a roll or getting a completely honest answer to a question. Multiple Luck points may be used at a time in order to achieve a greater advantage.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Rolling</h2>
      <p>
        When rolling, the employee will use a 10 sided die (1d10). The employee will always roll at least one die for the attribute check; if they employee is prepared, they will be able to roll another die; if the employee has expertise or prior experience with the situation, they can roll another die; and if they have assistance, they can roll another die.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Critical Failure</strong>: If <em>no dice</em> succeed, the roll is a critical failure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Failure</strong>: If <em>once die</em> succeeds, the roll is a mild failure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Mild Success</strong>: If <em>two dice</em> succeed, the roll is a mild success.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Great Success</strong>: If <em>three dice</em> succeed, the roll is a great success.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Stunning Success</strong>: If <em>four or more dice</em> succeed, the roll is a stunning success.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Resilience</h2>
      <p>
        Resilience is the employee's ability to dodge or endure attacks before taking damage. If a combatant's attack damage is less than the employee's Resilience, then the employee will take no damage. Every time an employee's Resilience successfully blocks an attack, the employee's Resilience will be lowered by 1 point and will remain at that score until the employee is able to rest or repair their Resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The Resilience score is the total of all the left side attribute points + 2.</em>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Health</h2>
      <p>
        Health is the amount of damage an employee can take before going unconscious. <strong>*Caution*</strong> If an employee is unconscious and takes sustained damage, risk of death is likely.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a combatant's attack damage is greater than the employee's Resilience, then the employee's Health will be lowered by the attack damage minus the employee's Resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The Health score is the total number of all the right side attribute points &times; 10 + 20.</em>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Combat</h2>
      <p>
        While in the field, there is a possibility of conflict with enemy combatants and therefore knowledge of armed combat is essential. Combat occurs in group turns in which all employees attack or perform actions in a group and then combatants may do the same. In a turn, employees may perform up to two action checks. The first turn goes to the group that initiated the encounter.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Weapons</h3>
      <p>
        Each employee should have a Main Weapon and a Side Arm. Each weapon has a designated attribute check, so when rolling, the employee will need to use their corresponding attribute to calculate damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Main Weapon for each employee has the ability to have two modifications. Modifications are not issued by the Space Door Program but may be found while in the field and can alter or add bonuses to an employee's weapon.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Damage</h3>
      <p>
        When rolling for damage, the employee will roll the number of dice needed as determined by preparation, expertise, assistance, or any other advantages. For left side attributes, the damage is calculated as the number on the die minus the attribute rang, and for the right side, it is the attribute rank minus the die roll. If the die roll exceeds the attribute rank, then damage will be 0. The damage for all dice is then added together and is the total attack damage against the combatant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Damage = left side attribute - die roll <strong>*OR*</strong> right side attribute - die roll</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example</em>: An employee who is attacking with preparation and has a score of 8 in Heavy Weight using a weapon that has a Heavy Weight check and a +1 damage modifier, would roll two dice. If the first die rolled 2 and the second rolled 5, the damage would be 8-2 + 8-5 + 1 = 10.
